            <h2>Impact on Individuals</h2>
            <p>Siblings of individuals with disabilities face unique challenges, including heightened emotional, social, and academic hurdles. Studies indicate that these siblings are at greater risk of depressive symptoms due to societal stigma and the burden of early caregiving responsibilities (Smith et al., 2016). They often delay milestones like education and career advancements to prioritize family needs.</p>

        <section id="relationships">
            <h2>Impact on Intimate Relationships</h2>
            <p>Early caregiving roles can hinder emotional development, making it difficult for siblings to form intimate bonds. Prioritizing family over personal relationships often results in social isolation (Plessis et al., 2020). Solutions include couple therapy and fostering understanding among partners.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="families">
            <h2>Impact on Families</h2>
            <p>Families with disabled children often experience role imbalances. Parental focus on the disabled child can lead to resentment among siblings, who may feel overlooked. External support from therapy, respite care, and community organizations is crucial for maintaining family harmony (Waldman et al., 2015).</p>

        <section id="theories">
            <h2>Theoretical Framework</h2>
            <h3>Family Life Cycle Theory</h3>
            <p>This theory explains delays in personal milestones for siblings due to caregiving priorities (Smith et al., 2016).</p>
            <h3>Psychosocial Development Theory</h3>
            <p>Explores how caregiving roles during adolescence impact identity formation and intimacy (Plessis et al., 2020).</p>
            <h3>Functionalism</h3>
            <p>Highlights the importance of balanced roles and external support to reduce stress and maintain family stability (Waldman et al., 2015).</p>
